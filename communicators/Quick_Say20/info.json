    "en": "Quick_Say20 is meant to provide grammatically correct, flexible, conversational ability that is as efficient as possible in a 4 row, 5 column format that is usable on a small tablet or phone. I positioned the most commonly used words close to the home page, prioritizing core language. Quick_Say20 may be a good choice for users who already have some grammar and literacy skills."
